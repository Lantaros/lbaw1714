# A11: Presentation
 
 
## 1. Product presentation
 
Our product is an event managing platform. Users can create and participate in events, as well as being able to leave 
comments and invite friends. When participating in an event, a user can also purchase tickets, which can be consulted 
in the user's profile.

Additionally, the website includes a simple community system; when creating an event for the community, all users belonging
to it will be notified of its existence, being a great way to share events with a specific friend group. Both events and 
communities have a visibility setting, with private elements being only visible to those who have been invited to it.

The website can be found at [http://lbaw1714.lbaw-prod.fe.up.pt](http://lbaw1714.lbaw-prod.fe.up.pt).
