### 2.1. Administration Credentials

The website administrators can access the administration menu using the hyperlink on the nav bar or on `http://lbaw1714.lbaw-prod.fe.up.pt/administration`.

## 3. Application Help

Users receive help mainly in three ways:

* The most visible one is the FAQ page, accessible on the page footer, as well as there being links to it on the main page.
* Secondly, there is some online help included in some forms; this help is marked with a small `(?)` next to the field's name.
* Finally, there's a third way of getting help, through the Contact page. Users can fill out a form and the administrators will receive an email with the User's message.

In order to minimize the need for these help methods, we tried to make the website as intuitive as possible, and we feel like these ways go a great length in assisting the user.


## 4. Input Validation

 On server-side, most of the input data is validated using Laravel's Validator, by checking restrictions as being null or not, the size of the string, etc.
 On client-side, the input data is validated by using Regex(pattern atribute) and the required attribute, as well as other HTML attributes.

 For example, when creating an event:
 * On client-side, the attributes required and maxlengh are used in the following inputs, as well as the type of the input itself(like type="date" or "type=time"

 ```html
      <input id="name" name="name" required type="text" style="width:100%;"
            class="form-control col-xs-3 is-invalid" placeholder="Enter event name" maxlength="80">

      <textarea id="description" name="description" required class="form-control"
            placeholder="Description" maxlength="255"
            style="width:100%;"> </textarea>

      <input id="startDate" name="startDate" required type="date"
            style="margin-right:0.25em" class="form-control col-lg-8" style="width:100%;">

      <input id="startTime" name="startTime" required type="time"
            class="form-control col-lg-3" style="width:100%;">

```


 * On server-side, the function `edit` on `EventController` validates every data, by calling the `validator` function, with some validation rules.

 ```php
protected function validator(array $data) {
   $validate = Validator::make($data, [
       'name' => 'required|string|max:64',
       'description' => 'required|string|max:516',
       'startDate'=> 'date_format:"Y-m-d',
       'startTime' => '',
       'endDate' => 'date_format:"Y-m-d|after_or_equal:startDate',
       'endTime' => '',
       'country' => 'required|string|exists:country,name',
       'ispublic'=> 'boolean',
       'address'=> 'nullable|string|max:50',
       'lodgingLink' => 'nullable',
   ]);
  return $validate;
}
```

## 5. Check Accessibility and Usability

The results of the accessiblilty test can be found in the file `acessibilidade.pdf`, while the usability test results are in `usabilidade.pdf`.

## 6. HTML & CSS Validation

The results of the HTML validation test (run on the Event page) can be found in the `event-html.pdf` file, while the CSS tests can be found in the `event-css.pdf` file.


## 7. Revisions to the Project


Our project evolved a lot since the beginning of the semester; we realized that some features would have to be either cut down or scrapped altogether; some of these features include flagging comments and posts, as well as interacting with events in more ways other than writing comments (such as using polls and uploading files).

However, we feel like the original idea still remained, and we did not deviate too much from the original idea of having a website based on finding the best events around.



## 8. Implementation Details

### 8.1. Libraries Used

We used several libraries and frameworks when developing this website:

In order to build the website structure, we used Docker, Laravel and Bootstrap; the effects of these frameworks can be found throughout the entire website.

Additionally, we used the FontAwesome, Material Icons and Google Fonts libraries in order to display more fonts than the system ones, as well as simple icons to accompany text; these can be seen in page titles, headers and buttons.

Finally, in order to show the event location maps on their pages, we used the Google Maps API to embed a small map with a pin to the event's address.
