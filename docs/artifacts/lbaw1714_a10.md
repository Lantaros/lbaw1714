## 3. Application Help
 
> Describe where help has been implemented, pointing to working examples.
 
 
## 4. Input Validation
 
> Describe how input data was validated, and provide examples to scenarios using HTML validation and server-side validation.
 
 On server-side, most of the input data is validated using Laravel's Validator, by checking restrictions as being null or not, the size of the string, etc.
 On client-side, the input data is validated by using Regex(pattern atribute) and the required attribute, as well as other HTML attributes.
 
 For example, when creating an event:
 * On client-side, the attributes required and maxlengh are used in the following inputs, as well as the type of the input itself(like type="date" or "type=time"
 
 ```html
      <input id="name" name="name" required type="text" style="width:100%;"
            class="form-control col-xs-3 is-invalid" placeholder="Enter event name" maxlength="80">
      
      <textarea id="description" name="description" required class="form-control"
            placeholder="Description" maxlength="255"
            style="width:100%;"> </textarea>

      <input id="startDate" name="startDate" required type="date"
            style="margin-right:0.25em" class="form-control col-lg-8" style="width:100%;">             

      <input id="startTime" name="startTime" required type="time"
            class="form-control col-lg-3" style="width:100%;">               
          
```

 
 * On server-side, the function *edit* on *EventController* validates every data, by calling the *validator* function, with some validation rules
 ```php
protected function validator(array $data) {
   $validate = Validator::make($data, [
       'name' => 'required|string|max:64',
       'description' => 'required|string|max:516',
       'startDate'=> 'date_format:"Y-m-d',
       'startTime' => '',
       'endDate' => 'date_format:"Y-m-d|after_or_equal:startDate',
       'endTime' => '',
       'country' => 'required|string|exists:country,name',
       'ispublic'=> 'boolean',
       'address'=> 'nullable|string|max:50',
       'lodgingLink' => 'nullable',
   ]);
  return $validate;
}
```
